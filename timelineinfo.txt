0	0	20/07/1996	creation	The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries,[2] and the most economically significant plant in the Bromeliaceae family.[3] Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit,[4] possibly flowering in 20–24 months and fruiting in the following six months.[4][5] Pineapple does not ripen significantly post-harvest.	event01.jpg	event02.jpg	event03.jpg
0	1	14/05/1998	development 1	he word "pineapple" in English was first recorded in 1398, when it was originally used to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed pine cones). The term "pine cone" for the reproductive organ of conifer trees was first recorded in 1694	event11.jpg	event12.jpg

1	3	10/05/2000	creation	The ovaries develop into berries which coalesce into a large, compact, multiple accessory fruit. The fruit of a pineapple is arranged in two interlocking helices, eight in one direction, thirteen in the other, each being a Fibonacci number.	event31.jpg
1	4	30/07/2010	development 1	The flesh and juice of the pineapple are used in cuisines around the world. In many tropical countries, pineapple is prepared, and sold on roadsides as a snack. It is sold whole, or in halves with a stick inserted. Whole, cored slices with a cherry in the middle are a common garnish on hams in the West.	event41.jpg	event42.png	event43.jpg

2	6	06/10/2005	development 2	The plant is indigenous to South America and is said to originate from the area between southern Brazil and Paraguay; however, little is known about the origin of the domesticated pineapple (Pickersgill, 1976). M.S. Bertoni (1919)[16] considered the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages to be the place of origin of A. comosus.	event61.jpg

2	8	28/04/2013	development 4	Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases, the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs[34] typically found on the surface of pineapples, but possibly in the closed blossom cups. 	event81.png	event82.JPG
3	9	17/09/2002	creation	Some buyers prefer green fruit, others ripened or off-green. A plant growth regulator, Ethephon, is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest, developing ethylene, which turns the fruit golden yellow.	event91.jpg
3	10	10/01/2004	development 1	In the Caribbean, Europe and North America, the pineapple became associated with the return of ships from extended voyages, and an emblem of welcome and hospitality that made its way into contemporary art.	event10.jpg
3	11	20/06/2008	development 2	Peaches and nectarines are the same species, even though they are regarded commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, nectarines are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes	
4	12	19/03/2009	creation	Cultivated peaches are divided into clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh.	event121.jpeg	event122.jpg
4	13	10/11/2011	development 1	Although its botanical name Prunus persica refers to Persia (present Iran) from where it came to Europe, genetic studies suggest peaches originated in China	event131.jpg
4	14	15/10/2013 	development 2	eaches grow very well in a fairly limited range, since they have a chilling requirement that low altitude tropical areas cannot satisfy. In tropical and equatorial latitudes, such as Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, India and Nepal,	event141.jpg	event142.jpeg 
4	15	30/07/2014	development 3	There are hundreds of peach and nectarine cultivars. These are classified into two categories—the freestones and the clingstones. Freestones are those whose flesh separates readily from the pit.	event151.jpg
